The easiest way to work with brain tractography within Blender 3D is to either load them as tck and trk file (from DiPy o MRITRIX) or to compute them directly from the Python console of Blender.

First you need to installed the needed library (see script install_libs.py), this might not work for all system and you need to find where is the command for the Python interpreter of Blender (not the Python you are using in the system).

Then you need to load the streamlines and convert them into NURBS or anything that is Blender manageble.
